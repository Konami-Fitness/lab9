4,5: For the insert functions, we added insert form fields for each of the tables because they have different numbers of fields. The user can type in the data in each field and click the submit button when done to add their changes to the database. Our php file takes the post value from the form and based on that, assigns the appropraite number of vairables based on the number of input fields. Then those variables are concatenated into a SQL query which is executed to perform the change to the database.
